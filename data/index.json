    "about": [
        "an aspiring web/software developer with a strong passion for creating innovative, user-friendly digital solutions.\n\nMy interest in technology started long before I matriculated from Christel House South Africa in 2024. From a young age, I was fascinated by how technology shapes our world, and that curiosity naturally evolved into a desire to learn coding.\n\nAfter matric, I decided to fully focus on honing my coding skills and upskilling myself in the field. Over the past year, I’ve dedicated myself to learning and experimenting with various programming languages and frameworks. From front-end tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to back-end technologies like Node.js and Python, I’ve worked tirelessly to build a strong technical foundation. Through hands-on projects, I’ve gained practical experience in both web development and back-end systems, all while refining my problem-solving skills.\n\nWhat excites me most about development is the challenge of creating solutions that are both functional and intuitive for users. Whether it’s building responsive websites or developing server-side systems, I love the process of turning ideas into real, working applications. Each project has helped me not only grow technically but also develop a deeper understanding of the entire development lifecycle.\n\nNow that I’ve spent a year diving into coding full-time, I’m ready to take the next step and apply my skills in a professional environment. I’m eager to join a dynamic team where I can continue to learn, collaborate, and grow as a developer while contributing to impactful tech solutions.\n\nI’m excited to bring my passion, creativity, and fresh perspective to the tech industry, and I’m looking forward to the opportunity to create solutions that make a real difference."
